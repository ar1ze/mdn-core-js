# mdn-core-js

Currently working through JavaScript fundamentals via Mozilla's MDN Web Docs curriculum. With HTML structure and CSS styling under my belt, I'm now diving into the programming side of web development.

This repository tracks my progress as I learn core JavaScript concepts, from variables and functions to DOM manipulation and beyond. Building on my solid foundation in markup and styling, I'm developing the skills to make websites truly interactive and dynamic.
